</p>zOS+ require internet connectivity and a Microsoft account during initial device setup.
These are the minimum system requirements for installing zOS+ on a PC. If your device does not meet these requirements, you may not be able to install zOS+ on your device and might want to consider purchasing a new PC. If you are unsure whether your PC meets these requirements, you can check with your PC Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or, if your device is already currently Windows 11, you can use the PC Health Check app to assess compatibility. Note that this app does not check for graphics card or display, as most compatible devices will meet those requirements listed below.

Your device must support Windows 11 to install and you must have a valid Windows 11 Home Product Key to install
